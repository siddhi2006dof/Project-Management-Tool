# 📋 Project Management Tool

Hi! I'm Siddhi Dubey and this is my  web development project.  
The goal of this project is to build a  **Project Management Tool** where users can create and manage projects and tasks.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `frontend/` → For HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- `backend/` → For server-side code (Node.js and Express will be used)
- `README.md` → Project description and documentation

## 💡 My Plan

I will build this project step-by-step:

1. Design a basic webpage with HTML and CSS ✅  
2. Add project creation form using JavaScript 🛠️  
3. Create a backend using Node.js and Express 🛠️  
4. Connect frontend to backend using API calls 🔗  
5. Add task management inside each project 📝  
6. (Optional) Add user login/logout system 🔐
